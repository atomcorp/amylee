The HTML `<header>` element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.

The `<header>` element is not sectioning content and therefore does not introduce a new section in the outline. That said, a `<header>` element is intended to usually contain the surrounding section's heading (an h1â€“h6 element), but this is not required.
